# CCResetButton

Adds a button to restart the game without memory leaks

This currently only works on Windows, but can easily be updated for Mac and Linux.
I just need someone to help with testing on those platforms.

## Install

Install [CCLoader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader)

[Download a release](https://github.com/bluecheetah001/CCResetButton/releases) and unpack into the CCLoader mods folder

To keep the window in the same location after restarting add the option `"id": "CrossCode"` to the `"window"` object in CrossCode's package.json.

## Usage

Press <kbd>L</kbd> to restart the game. This can be configured at the bottom of the Controls tab
